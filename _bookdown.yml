# book_filename: sets the filename of the main Rmd file

# language: Allows for customization of the default titles. Eg: change fig to FIGURE

# delete_merged_file: deletes main Rmd file after book is sucessful rendered

# output_dir: sets the output diretory of the book

# rmd_files: allows to set custom order of Rmd files for the book

# These two problems are what caused (some of) the appendices to appear as chapters.
# Must use tabs (not spaces!) in this file, at least when indenting "html: [ ..."
# Also, if there are no "html: [" entries, it will just build every Rmd in the directory.
# Also, # (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} header is what starts the appendix.
