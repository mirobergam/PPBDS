# Shopping Week {-}

<!-- Add some sidemargin notes which provide more detail during the Set Up section. Most won't care what those weird R commands are doing but, for those that do, an explanation would be polite. -->

<!-- Create a test tutorial (Tutorial Zero) so students can see the whole process on Day 1. Ask questions which demonstrate that they have, in fact, issued the weird R commands we told them to. For example, what verion of Tidyverse are they running. We tell them the exact commands to issue. This is not so much a quiz as a way to guarantee that they are set up for success. -->

> The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere persuasion or at least a subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is betting. Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident and inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all concern for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he is persuaded enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily bet one, but at 10 he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not previously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred. -â€” Immanuel Kant, *Critique of Pure Reason*

The world confronts us. Make decisions we must.


## Warning {-}

This book is not the book you are looking for.

First, the book is for students in [Gov 50: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html) and [Gov 52: Models](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html), courses offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. Some of the material here may be useful to students outside of this class, but I don't really care if it is.

Second, the book changes all the time. It is as up-to-date as possible.

Third, I am highly opinionated about what matters and what does not. It is unlikely that you share my views. 

### Install R and RStudio

<!-- DK: Move all related material from Chapter 1 to here and the provide a link from there. -->

To start off, you'll need to download the necessary software:

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

2. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

But what are you installing? What is a R and RStudio anyways? Well, to clear some confusion, R is the programming language you'll be using in this class and RStudio is the IDE you'll be using. An IDE or Integrated development environment is an app that allows you to write code.

Think of installing R like telling your computer to learn French and installing RStudio as the way you can communicate with your computer in French.

Now, let's begin with getting familiar with RStudio. Begin by opening up RStudio. You should see something like this:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/rstudio.png")`

This is your workspace! You can see three main windows right now. Let's focus on the big one on the left:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/left_window.png")`

There are three tabs in this window, we'll be focusing on the Console and Terminal. When you first start R, the Console gives you some information about your version of R. At the time when this was written, 4.0.1 was the latest version of R! The Console is where you can type and run R code. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit return, the Console returns 2.

Next, let's move to the top right:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/top_right_window.png")`

Here, the main two tabs you'll be using is Environment and Git (Not Pictured Yet). The Environment tab shows you the datasets and variables you currently have loaded into RStudio. In my case, I loaded in a dataset with 3407 rows and 5 columns and a variable x equal to 5. For you, the Environment should be empty, so let's change that!

To create your first variable in RStudio, go to your Console and type:

```{eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
```

Now, hit return/enter and you should see a variable x equal to 5 in your Environment!

Now, last but not least, the bottom right window:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/bottom_right_window.png")`

Here, the Files tab will allow you to see your computer's file system. When you create a project later, this tab will automatically show the contents in your project folder. The plots tab will show you a preview of any plots you make later on in RStudio. Packages shows all the packages you have installed in RStudio so far. Help will be [explained later](#how-to-get-help) in this chapter.

### Initial Set Up Commands

In the R Console, type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(pkgType = "binary")
```

This causes R to download binary (i.e., pre-built) packages by default. Without this option set, you will occasionally be asked by R:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

Unless you have a good reason not to, always answer "no" to this question. 

Run these two other set-up commands in the R Console. (You should always be able to just copy and paste commands from the book.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", value = FALSE)
rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "save_workspace", value = "never")
```

### Package Installation

In the R Console, type the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This installs a large suite of packages for working with the "Tidyverse," the modern way of programming with R. (If you forget to set `options(pkgType = "binary")`, then you might be asked about installing from source or binary for several of these packages.) 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rstudio/learnr")
remotes::install_github("rundel/learnrhash")
remotes::install_github("davidkane9/PPBDS.data")
```

R packages generally live in one of two places: CRAN (rhymes with "clan") for more mature, popular packages and Github for more experimental, less popular packages. 

### Tutorials

For each chapter of the textbook, there is a corresponding tutorial available in the **PPBDS.data** package. In order to access these tutorials, follow these steps:

1. Run `library(PPBDS.data)` in the R Console.

<!-- Let's show some pictures for each of these steps --- or, even better, some gifs like Yao does elsewhere. -->

2. You can access the tutorials via the Tutorial pane in the top right tab in RStudio. Click "Start tutorial". In order to expand the window, you can drag and enlarge the tutorial pane inside RStudio. In order to open a popup window, click the "Show in New Window" icon next to the home icon.

3. Your work will be saved between sessions, so you can complete the tutorial in multiple sittings. In order to complete the tutorial successfully, make sure you enter your name at the very beginning and answer all questions. Once you have completed the tutorial, follow the instructions on the tutorial `Submit` page and upload the resulting `responses.rds` file to Canvas.
