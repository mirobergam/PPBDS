# This file is automatically sourced before each chapter is compiled. (Or is it
# before each session, regardless of the number of chapters being put together?
# That is, if chapter 4 changes the value for `option("digits")`, will the value
# be reset for chapter 5? For now, I doubt we need to worry about that since
# individual chapters rarely mess around with this stuff.)

# This is caused by this setting in _bookdown.yml.
