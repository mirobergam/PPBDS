# Question 1

### In this question, we're going to look at Asmer's 4 years at Harvard, and the courses he's taken during this time. We're going to use the `qscores` dataset in the *PPBDS.data* package for this question. 

### Q1a) For this first question, we'll be preparing our dataset for use. Remove the `term`, `prof_name`, `course_number` variables from the dataset. Next, we create two more datasets from our parent dataset, `qscores`. Create a separate dataset for 13 Government courses, and another that samples 19 random courses from the parent data. Join these two datasets together, to form a dataset with 32 observations - one for each course. Reorder the data using `sample_n()`, to randomly shuffle the observations. 

```{r, prepping data}

# Eduting dataset to remove irrelevant variables

qscores1 <- qscores %>% 
  select(-term, -prof_name, -course_number) 

# Creating a dataset for major courses only, by filtering
# for courses in the government department only. 

gov <- qscores1 %>% 
  filter(department == "GOV") %>% 
  head(13)

# Randomly sampling 19 courses from the qscores1 dataset.
# 19 + 13 is equal to 32. 

qscores2 <- qscores1 %>% 
  sample_n(19)

# join the qscores2 (the other 19 courses she takes) and 
# the GOV major courses she takes by other variables, to form 
# a dataset of 32 courses

joinedgovqs2 <- gov %>% 
  full_join(qscores2, by = c('department', 
                             'enrollment', 
                             'workload',
                             'overall',
                             'course_name'))

# More variations can be added, to accommodate for GENEDs,
# secondaries etc too. 

```

### Q1b) Asmer was a Government major. He wants to create a column called `course_detail` that specifies if the courses he took count for his concentration requirements. Create the column, specifying "Concentration" for Government department courses, and "Other" for the rest. Use `map_chr()`. 


```{r, major}

# For major 

get_gov <- function(x) {
  grepl("GOV", x)
  
}

joinedgovqs2 <- joinedgovqs2 %>% 
  tibble(course_detail = map_chr(department, ~ if_else(get_gov(.), "Concentration", "Other"))) 

```

```{r, reordering data randomly}

# reordering data

j <- sample_n(joinedgovqs2, 32)



```


```{r}
# Numbered function to number by courses. 
# Can also be done without a function, this was just me experimenting

numbered <- function(x){
  x %>% 
  mutate(year_no = rep(1:8, 4))
  
}

j <- numbered(j)
j
```


```{r}
# Calculate percentage of workload in each group of numbers.
# 1s taken one year, 2s in the other. 


# First create a column for sum of hours spent a year/week 
j <- j %>% 
  group_by(year_no) %>% 
  mutate(total_hrs = sum(workload))

# Create a function that uses this sum to calculate the workload percentage
# for each class, in a semester 


j <- j %>%
  mutate(perc_hr = (workload / total_hrs) * 100) %>% 
  mutate(perc_hr = round(perc_hr, 1))


j
```

```{r}

# Must take courses - ratings over 4

class_rec <- function(x){
  
  if_else((x >= 4.2),  "Highly Recommend", "Not important")
}

j <- j %>% 
  mutate(take_course = map_chr(overall, ~ class_rec(.))) 

j
```
