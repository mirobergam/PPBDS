# Appendices {-}

<!-- Notes: 
Explain importance of scripting versus click-and-drag and copy-pasting.
Add section about useful keyboard shortcuts. -->

<!-- Add a section about creating a place, perhaps ~/Desktop/projects, for all your projects and making that the default. -->

<!-- Find a place to mention all the high quality sources listed below, perhaps in sidemargins. Maybe with a webshot of their title pages?  -->

<!-- 1) Don't reinvent the wheel. We should never explain X is X is already explained elsewhere online for free. Our main goal is to curate and organize an excellent list of other references. -->

<!-- 2) Use high quality sources.  -->
<!--   + For git/Github that is Happy Git for the R User. Maybe also [this](https://emmal73.github.io/github_slides.html). -->
<!--   + For R/RStudio issues that is anything associated with RStudio.  -->
<!--   + For command lines, we probably want to write our own, based heavily on  [The UNIX Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/), but with all the work done form the terminal window in RStudio. (How differently does the RStudio Terminal window behave across operating systems.)  Perhaps the single biggest confusion among students is not understanding how a process can be run from two different places. This causes endless problems when students build their own Shiny App later. -->
<!--   + For workflow issues, we want [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/), which is CC so we might use a lot of it. -->
<!-- + This is another high quality source: https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup. Might just pull out the key sections of this. We can't just link to it since some of it --- like devtools --- is too confusing. -->

<!-- 3) Point, don't tell. We don't want this to be too long/overwhelming. -->

<!-- 4) Connect the order of the topics to the order in which we use them in class. Maybe the separate subparts are specifically assigned in the syllabus? That is, this is not a reference. -->

<!-- 5) Create some tutorial questions. The only way we can force students to do this stuff is to assign it. Of course, to the extent this stuff is truly important, it (and all the other appendices?!?) belong in the main chapters. -->


<!-- gifs of the steps in the tutorial section -->

<!-- 7) Consider making the **fs** package a major part of the presentation. This helps avoid dealing with cross-OS issues ourselves. -->

<!-- 9) Add some optional videos, especially the ones from RStudio which give nice tours of RStudio stuff. -->

The chapter will be broken into the following sections:

* [Working with the Terminal](#working-with-the-terminal)
* [Git, GitHub, and RStudio](#git-github-rstudio)
* [PDF](#pdf)
* [How to get Help](#how-to-get-help)


## Working with the Terminal

The terminal is a very powerful window because it allows you to interact with your computer's filesystem directly without having to touch your mouse or trackpad! Learning how to work with the filesystem is important to keep your work organized and quickly allow you to move files across folders.

Now, let's open up the Terminal tab on the left window and start learning how to use the Terminal.

### `pwd`: Working directory

The first question you may have about working in the Terminal might be: If I can't see the folders, how do I know where I am? Well that's a great place to start learning the Terminal. To see what our current folder is, we type `pwd` (preview working directory):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/pwd.png")
```

Here, we can see that I'm currently in my user folder `Yao`.

### `ls`: Seeing items in the directory

Ok, but how does knowing what folder I'm in help me see what's actually in the folder? Well, to see the items in our current folder, we use the command `ls` (long listing):

Type `ls` in the terminal and hit return/enter. You should see something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/ls.png")
```

Notice that this lists exactly the same items as the bottom right window! The terminal is just another way to interact with your computer's filesystem! Anything you can do normally with your mouse/trackpad, like opening a folder, you can also do in the Terminal.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/ls_icons.png")
```

### `cd`: Changing directories

Speaking of opening folders, let's open a few folders to enter a more familiar place. To open and close folders, we use `cd` (change directory). We'll be using `cd` to change into the Desktop folder, a place we should all be familiar with.

To change into the Desktop directory, we type `cd Desktop/`. A helpful hint, after you type the first few letters of a folder or file name, you can hit tab and the computer will auto complete the name. Try it! type `cd Desk` and then hit tab to auto complete the name!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/cd_desktop.png")
```

Now, if you type `ls` again, you can see all the item on your Desktop listed! 

To go back to the previous folder (aka the directory above), we can type `cd ..` The two periods represent one level above. You can see this hierarchy in this view on a Mac:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/directory_hierarchy.png")
```

### `mkdir` and `rmdir`: Make and remove a directory

Now that we're in the Desktop folder, let's get set-up to stay organized for Gov 50. Staying organized is critical when working with many data projects. So, using `mkdir Gov-50` (make directory) we can create a folder exclusively for Gov 50 like so:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/mkdir.png")
```

Now, when we type ls, we can see our new folder created! Note that we used a hyphen between Gov and 50. This is because the Terminal can't recognize spaces unless you put `\` before it, like so: `mkdir Gov\ 50`. You can read more on programming naming convention [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)).

To remove a folder, use `rmdir` (remove directory). We won't be using this right now because we don't need to remove anything.

### `touch:` Creating files

In order to experiment with the next few commands in the Terminal, we'll need a test file. So, let's create a test.txt file to play round with. To create a file, we use `touch`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/touch.png")
```

And, of course, we can see that the test.txt file has been created using `ls`.

### `mv`: Moving files

Oh no! We created our test.txt file, but it should be in our Gov-50 folder, right now it's on the desktop. This happened because while we created the Gov-50 folder using `mkdir`, we forgot to open it using `cd Gov-50/`. But no worries, we can move the file to that folder using `mv`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/mv.png")
```

When using `mv` the first thing you type after `mv` is the file you want to move. The next thing is the location where you want to move it to. In our case we want to move test.txt to Gov-50/ so we type `mv test.txt Gov-50/`. After we do this, we can use `cd` to enter the Gov-50 folder and then use `ls` to see that our test.txt file successfully was moved into the Gov-50 folder:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/mv_confirm.png")
```

### `cp`: Copying files

Copying files is very similar to moving files in the Terminal. Using the previous example, if we wanted to copy test.txt into the Gov-50 folder but not delete the original test.txt file, we just replace `mv` with `cp` (copy paste):

```{r eval=FALSE}
cp test.txt Gov-50/
```


### `rm`: Removing files

Ok, we are at the last Terminal command that this book will be teaching you. So, we're done with this test.txt file. Let's remove it with `rm` (remove):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/mv_confirm.png")
```

Make sure you are the in Gov-50 folder before you type `rm test.txt`! Using `ls`, we can see that our test file is now gone.

Congrats! You are now able to do most basic tasks with the Terminal! If you want to learn more Terminal commands, check out Sean Kross's [The Unix Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/).


## Git, GitHub, and RStudio {#git-github-rstudio}

This next section focuses on connecting GitHub with RStudio using Git. Why do we care about GitHub? Think of it as a Google Drive for all your R code and projects! If your computer blows up, GitHub will save all your R work just as Google Drive saves your Expos paper.

### Installing Git 

The first step to using GitHub is installing Git on your computer. But first, do you have Git already installed on your computer? To check, go to your Terminal and type `git --version`. If you already have Git, this command will return you the git version you have instlled. If you get an error, you can download and install git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### GitHub accounts

After installing git, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account. This is like a Google account for your Drive. However, the one difference with GitHub is that your account is visible to the public! So, you want to pick a name carefully. It should be professional as you might be sending potential employers a link to your GitHub account in the near future! Check out some former Gov 50 students' GitHub profiles for inspiration: 

1. [Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn)

2. [Jessica Edwards](https://github.com/jessie9111)

Once you have a GitHub account, you are ready to connect Git and RStudio to this account. Type the following two commands in your terminal window to link the two. Replace "Your Name" with your name and "your@email.com" with the email you used to sign up for GitHub.

```{eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.mail "your@email.com"
```

### GitHub repositories

You are now ready to create a GitHub repository (repo). The GitHub repo is similar to a Google Drive folder. To make your first repo, make sure you are signed in and then go to the GitHub [homepage](https://github.com/) and click on the green `new` button on the left.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/new_repo.png")
```

You will then want to choose a good name for the repo and add a brief description. Here we will use `productivity`. You can choose to make the repo public or private, but we recommend that you only make a repo public if it is important for the world to see. This keeps your public GitHub profile clean and professional. So, this repo should probably be private. Let's also add a REAME file for our repo. This is a document where you can add more deatils about your repo for the public.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/repo_details.png")
```

You now have your first repo on GitHub. The next step will be to _clone it_ on your computer and start editing and syncing using Git. To do this, we'll need to copy the link to the repo and then use it in RStudio. Once again, the green button is your friend. Click on it and then copy the link shown (You can use the clipboard button on the right to auto-copy it).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/repo_clone.png")
```

### Connecting GitHub to RStudio

Alright! We are now ready to connect your `productivity` repo to RStudio! With our repo link copied, we can go back to RStudio and begin with creating a new project. You can do this by going to File then New Project:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/new_project.png")
```


Next, you'll need to go through these steps to create the project: Version Control to Git to paste your link from GitHub and click Create Project.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/new_project.gif")
```

Congrats! You've linked your `productivity` repo to RStudio.

### Updating .gitignore

The first time you should always do when working with a new repo is updating the .gitignore file. You can open this file from the bottom right window under the Files tab. This file includes all the files that you don't want to be uploaded to GitHub. This can come in handy when you are working with big datasets or files with private information. In our case, we want to add the .Rproj file to the .gitignore list. You can see that Git currently wants you to upload this file to GitHub:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/rproj_git.png")
```

This file is your private project file and usually you don't want this uploaded to GitHub. So, in .gitignore, you'll want to add `*.Rproj` The * tells your computer that we want to keep all files ending in .Rproj from being uploaded:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/rproj.png")
```

Now, save the .gitignore file and you should see the .Rproj file dissapear from your Git tab in the top right window. If you don't see any changes, click on the refresh button!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/updated_gitignore.png")
```

### Commit and Push

Now that we've updated our .gitignore file, we want to upload this new version to GitHub. To do this, first select the .gitignore file and then click on the `Commit` button in the Git window:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/commit.png")
```

This will open a new window where you will write a Commit message. This message is a small note on what you're adding/changing in the repo. In our case, we've updated the .gitignore so let's write just that:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/commit_push.png")
```


Then, you want to press `commit`. This is your way of telling Git "Yes these are the files I want to upload. I'm committed." Next, you want to press `push`. This pushes or uploads the files to GitHub. (You can probably guess what pull does, but we won't be using that yet)

Now, if you go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page, you can see that the .gitignore file has been uploaded with your commit message:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/github_updating.gif")
```

Congrats! You just uploaded your first file to GitHub.

## PDF

Generating PDF files from RStudio is both easy and hard. It is easy because R markdown is designed to produce files in a variety of output formats, [including PDF](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html). It is hard because, for RStudio to make PDF files, your computer set up must be set up with a [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX installation. You have four options:

1) Making PDF files may just "work," especially if you are using a Mac. Give it a try!

2) If it doesn't just work, we *strongly* recommend using the **[tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)** R package. Type these commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Restart R and everything should just work. 

3) You can just generate an html file, open it in Chrome, select *Print . . .* from the drop-down menu. You will get a pop-up window. Click the down arrow to the right of *Destination* and choose *Save as PDF* in the drop-down menu. You’ll see a preview. Choose the *Save as PDF* option. This is not a convenient workflow but, if disaster strikes and the problem set is due in 10 minutes, it is a reasonable option.

4) You can install a full LaTeX installation yourself. Good luck! Don't come to us for help.

## How to get Help

This final section teaches you how to find and get help when you don't know how to do something in R. This is perhaps the most important sections because you won't always have Preceptor, the Teaching Assistants, or your peers to help you. So, you need to learn how to be resilient when you get stuck.

### Searching for Help with R

Google is your best friend. If you have a question about doing something in R, someone has probably had the same question and someone else has probably answered it online. [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com/) and [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) are two of the best forums for finding and asking questions/solutions. Adding `r` in your keyword search helps find more relevant results to your exact question. Be as specific as possible in wording your question!

### Reproducible Examples

In the rare case that you don't find an answer to your question and you're still stuck, then you might want to ask your own question on these forums! In order to get the best response, sharing a reproducible example with the community allows others to easily start where you left off. The **reprex** package allows you to do this easily.

First, install the **reprex** package in the Console:

```{eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")
```

Then, load the package. You can also do this in the Console!

```{eval=FALSE}
library(reprex)
```

To use reprex, first you want to copy the code that you have so far. For example, you might have something like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nj_primary_2020 +
  mutate(weight = 1.2 * response_3)
```

This code results in an error because I am using a `+` instead of a `%>%`. But, to use **reprex**, I would copy all of this code and then type `reprex()` in the Console. **reprex** then automatically creates a reproducible example and copies it to your clipboard. So, all you have to do now is go to your favorite R forum and paste your reproducible example in your question!
