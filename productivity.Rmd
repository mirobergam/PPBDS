<!-- Notes: 
Explain importance of scripting versus click-and-drag and copy-pasting.
Add section about useful keyboard shortcuts.
-->

<!-- This chapter is an excellent idea, but also fundamentally flawed in implemention. First, it is a great idea to have a dedicated resource, designed for our use, which we can point students to. We don't want to explain 100 times how to confirm that git is installed correctly. Second, the actual implementation here stinks. To fix: -->

<!-- 1) Don't reinvent the wheel. We should never explain X is X is already explained elsewhere online for free. Our main goal is to curate and organize an excellent list of other references. -->

<!-- 2) Use high quality sources.  -->
<!--   + For git/Github that is Happy Git for the R User. Maybe also [this](https://emmal73.github.io/github_slides.html). -->
<!--   + For R/RStudio issues that is anything associated with RStudio.  -->
<!--   + For command lines, we probably want to write our own, based heavily on  [The UNIX Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/), but with all the work done form the terminal window in RStudio. (How differently does the RStudio Terminal window behave across operating systems.)  Perhaps the single biggest confusion among students is not understanding how a process can be run from two different places. This causes endless problems when students build their own Shiny App later. -->
<!--   + For workflow issues, we want [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/), which is CC so we might use a lot of it. -->
<!-- + This is another high quality source: https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup. Might just pull out the key sections of this. We can't just link to it since some of it --- like devtools --- is too confusing. -->

<!-- 3) Point, don't tell. We don't want this to be too long/overwhelming. -->

<!-- 4) Connect to weeks 1 and 2. This is assigned for week 1, but it will naturally spill over into the following two weeks. Also, connect the order of the topics to the order in which we use them in class. Maybe they are separate chapters, one for each week? -->

<!-- 5) Create some tutorial questions. The only way we can force students to do this stuff is to assign it. -->

<!-- 6) Make sure to cover obscure topics which matter to us. For example, the .gitignore file and, maybe, what the .Rproj file does. Make sure, at the beginning, to require the setting up of RStudio correctly. Specifically:

* rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", value = FALSE) doesn't load the previous workspace upon startup
 * rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "save_workspace", value = "never") doesn't save workspace after R session quits without prompting the user for an answer 

-->

<!-- 7) Consider making the **fs** package a major part of the presentation. This helps avoid dealing with cross-OS issues ourselves. -->

<!-- 8) With luck, we can delete the high level images/ directory since we won't use it anymore. -->

Treat this chapter as a reference area to help you get your computer set up and get familiar with the R/RStudio/Git/GitHub environment and tools.

The chapter will be broken into the following sections:

* [R and RStudio](r-and-rstudio)
* [Working with the Terminal](#working-with-the-terminal)
* [Git, GitHub, and RStudio](#git-github-rstudio)
* [How to get Help](#how-to-get-help)


## R and RStudio

<!-- How detailed should this be? Maybe just links and explaining R before RStudio? -->

To start off, you'll need to download the necessary software:

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

2. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

But what are you installing? What is a R and RStudio anyways? Well, to clear some confusion, R is the programming language you'll be using in this class and RStudio is the IDE you'll be using. An IDE or Integrated development environment is an app that allows you to write code.

Think of installing R like telling your computer to learn French and installing RStudio as the way you can communicate with your computer in French.

Now, let's begin with getting familiar with RStudio. Begin by opening up RStudio. You should see something like this:

`r include_graphics("other/images/rstudio.png")`

This is your workspace! You can see three main windows right now. Let's focus on the big one on the left:

`r include_graphics("other/images/left_window.png")`

There are three tabs in this window, we'll be focusing on the Console and Terminal. When you first start R, the Console gives you some information about your version of R. At the time when this was written, 4.0.1 was the latest version of R! The Console is where you can type and run R code. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit return, the Console returns 2.

Next, let's move to the top right:

`r include_graphics("other/images/top_right_window.png")`

Here, the main two tabs you'll be using is Environment and Git (Not Pictured Yet). The Environment tab shows you the datasets and variables you currently have loaded into RStudio. In my case, I loaded in a dataset with 3407 rows and 5 columns and a variable x equal to 5. For you, the Environment should be empty, so let's change that!

To create your first variable in RStudio, go to your Console and type:

```{eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
```

Now, hit return/enter and you should see a variable x equal to 5 in your Environment!

Now, last but not least, the bottom right window:

`r include_graphics("other/images/bottom_right_window.png")`

Here, the Files tab will allow you to see your computer's file system. When you create a project later, this tab will automatically show the contents in your project folder. The plots tab will show you a preview of any plots you make later on in RStudio. Packages shows all the packages you have installed in RStudio so far. Help will be explained later in this chapter and you won't be using viewer for this course.


## Working with the Terminal

The terminal is a very powerful window because it allows you to interact with your computer's filesystem directly without having to touch your mouse or trackpad! Learning how to work with the filesystem is important to keep your work organized and quickly allow you to move files across folders.

Now, let's open up the Terminal tab on the left window and start learning how to use the Terminal.

### `pwd`: Working directory

The first question you may have about working in the Terminal might be: If I can't see the folders, how do I know where I am? Well that's a great place to start learning the Terminal. To see what our current folder is, we type `pwd` (preview working directory):

`r include_graphics("other/images/pwd.png")`

Here, we can see that I'm currently in my user folder `Yao`.

### `ls`: Seeing items in the directory

Ok, but how does knowing what folder I'm in help me see what's actually in the folder? Well, to see the items in our current folder, we use the command `ls` (long listing):

Type `ls` in the terminal and hit return/enter. You should see something like this:

`r include_graphics("other/images/ls.png")`

Notice that this lists exactly the same items as the bottom right window! The terminal is just another way to interact with your computer's filesystem! Anything you can do normally with your mouse/trackpad, like opening a folder, you can also do in the Terminal.

`r include_graphics("other/images/ls_icons.png")`

### `cd`: Changing directories

Speaking of opening folders, let's open a few folders to enter a more familiar place. To open and close folders, we use `cd` (change directory). We'll be using `cd` to change into the Desktop folder, a place we should all be familiar with.

To change into the Desktop directory, we type `cd Desktop/`. A helpful hint, after you type the first few letters of a folder or file name, you can hit tab and the computer will auto complete the name. Try it! type `cd Desk` and then hit tab to auto complete the name!

`r include_graphics("other/images/cd_desktop.png")`

Now, if you type `ls` again, you can see all the item on your Desktop listed! 

To go back to the previous folder (aka the directory above), we can type `cd ..` The two periods represent one level above. You can see this hierarchy in this view on a Mac:

`r include_graphics("other/images/directory_hierarchy.png")`

### `mkdir` and `rmdir`: Make and remove a directory

Now that we're in the Desktop folder, let's get set-up to stay organized for Gov 50. Staying organized is critical when working with many data projects. So, using `mkdir Gov-50` (make directory) we can create a folder exclusively for Gov 50 like so:

`r include_graphics("other/images/mkdir.png")`

Now, when we type ls, we can see our new folder created! Note that we used a hyphen between Gov and 50. This is because the Terminal can't recognize spaces unless you put `\` before it, like so: `mkdir Gov\ 50`. You can read more on programming naming convention [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)).

To remove a folder, use `rmdir` (remove directory). We won't be using this right now because we don't need to remove anything.

### `touch:` Creating files

In order to experiment with the next few commands in the Terminal, we'll need a test file. So, let's create a test.txt file to play round with. To create a file, we use `touch`:

`r include_graphics("other/images/touch.png")`

And, of course, we can see that the test.txt file has been created using `ls`.

### `mv`: Moving files

Oh no! We created our test.txt file, but it should be in our Gov-50 folder, right now it's on the desktop. This happened because while we created the Gov-50 folder using `mkdir`, we forgot to open it using `cd Gov-50/`. But no worries, we can move the file to that folder using `mv`:

`r include_graphics("other/images/mv.png")`

When using `mv` the first thing you type after `mv` is the file you want to move. The next thing is the location where you want to move it to. In our case we want to move test.txt to Gov-50/ so we type `mv test.txt Gov-50/`. After we do this, we can use `cd` to enter the Gov-50 folder and then use `ls` to see that our test.txt file successfully was moved into the Gov-50 folder:

`r include_graphics("other/images/mv_confirm.png")`

### `cp`: Copying files

Copying files is very similar to moving files in the Terminal. Using the previous example, if we wanted to copy test.txt into the Gov-50 folder but not delete the original test.txt file, we just replace `mv` with `cp` (copy paste):

```{r eval=FALSE}
cp test.txt Gov-50/
```


### `rm`: Removing files

Ok, we are at the last Terminal command that this book will be teaching you. So, we're done with this test.txt file. Let's remove it with `rm` (remove):

`r include_graphics("other/images/mv_confirm.png")`

Make sure you are the in Gov-50 folder before you type `rm test.txt`! Using `ls`, we can see that our test file is now gone.

Congrats! You are now able to do most basic tasks with the Terminal! If you want to learn more Terminal commands, check out Sean Kross's [The Unix Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/).


## Git, GitHub, and RStudio

### Installing Git 

<!-- Happy Git With R has more details. Emma's instructions are super concise and much easier to read. Leaving both for reference, just cleaning up rn --->

https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html

https://emmal73.github.io/github_slides.html#15


### Why Git and GitHub?

Here we provide some details on Git and GitHub. However, we are only scratching the surface. To learn more about this topic, read [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](http://happygitwithr.com/). There are three main reasons to use Git and GitHub.

1. Sharing: Even if we do not take advantage of the advanced and powerful version control functionality, we can still use Git and GitHub to share our code.

2. Collaborating: Once you set up a central repo, you can have multiple people make changes to code and keep versions synced. GitHub provides a free service for centralized repos.

3. Version control: The version control capabilities of Git permit us to keep track of changes we make to our code. We can also revert back to previous versions of files. 

Here we focus on the sharing aspects of Git and GitHub and refer the reader to the links above to learn more about this powerful tool.


### GitHub accounts

After installing git, the first step is to get a GitHub account. Basic GitHub accounts are free. To do this, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/join).

You want to pick a name carefully. It should be short, easy to remember and to spell, somehow related to your name, and professional. This last one is important since you might be sending potential employers a link to your GitHub account. Check out some former Gov 50 students' GitHub profiles for inspiration: 

1. [Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn)

2. [Jessica Edwards](https://github.com/jessie9111)

Once you have a GitHub account, you are ready to connect Git and RStudio to this account. Type the following two commands in our terminal window to link the two:

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.mail "your@email.com"
```

Note that the terminal window is different than the console window! 

(Add image here)

### GitHub repositories

You are now ready to create a GitHub repository (repo). The general idea is that you will have at least two copies of your code: one on your computer and one on GitHub. If you add collaborators to this project, then each will have a copy on their computer. The GitHub repo provides an easy way to store a version of your code to the cloud. (Think of it as Google Drive for code!)

As mentioned, one of the advantages of keeping code on a GitHub repository is that you can easily share it with potential employers interested in seeing examples of your work. Because many data science companies use version control systems, like Git, to collaborate on projects, they might also be impressed that you already know at least the basics.

To make your first repo, make sure you are signed in and then go to the GitHub [homepage](https://github.com/) and click on the green `new` button on the left.

You will then want to choose a good name for the repo and add a brief description. In the future, you might have dozens of repos so keep that in mind when choosing a name. Here we will use `homework-0`. You can choose to make the repo public or private. We recommend that you only make a repo public if you want to shrae it with the world. This keeps your public GitHub profile clean for the world to see. Sadly, your future employer probably doesn't care what you did in-class last Tuesday. Your final project for this class should be in a public repo (You should be proud to share that!).

You now have your first repo on GitHub. The next step will be to _clone it_ on your computer and start editing and syncing using Git.

To do this, we'll need to copy the link to the repo and then use it in RStudio. Once again, the green button is your friend. Click on it and then copy the link shown (You can use the clipboard button on the right to auto-copy it).

### Overview of Git

The main actions in Git are to:

1. **pull** changes from the remote repo, in this case the GitHub repo
2. **add** files, or as we say in the Git lingo _stage_ files
3. **commit** changes to the local repo
4. **push** changes to the _remote_ repo, in our case the GitHub repo

To effectively permit version control and collaboration in Git, files move across four different areas:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"git/git-layout.png"))
```

But how does it all get started? There are two ways: we can clone an existing repo or initialize one. We will explore cloning first.

#### Clone

### Using Git and GitHub in RStudio

While command line Git is a powerful and flexible tool, it can be somewhat daunting when we are getting started. RStudio provides a graphical interface that facilitates the use of Git in the context of a data analysis project. We describe how to use this RStudio feature to do this here.

Now we are ready to start an RStudio project that uses version control and stores the code on a GitHub repo. To do this, we start a project but, instead of _New Directory_, we will select _Version Control_ and then we will select _Git_ as our version control system:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
##knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[86:87])
```

The repository URL is the link you used to clone. In Section \@ref(github-repos), we used `https://github.com/username/homework-0.git` as an example. In the project directory name, you need to put the name of the folder that was generated, which in our example will be the name of the repo `homework-0`. This will create a folder called `homework-0` on your local system. Once you do this, the project is created and it is aware of the connection to a GitHub repo. You will see on the top right corner the name and type of project as well as a new tab on the upper right pane titled _Git_.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
##knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[88:89])
```


If you select this tab, it will show you the files on your project with some icons that give you information about these files and their relationship to the repo. In the example below, we already added a file to the folder, called _code.R_ which you can see in the editing pane.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[90])
```

We now need to pay attention to the Git pane. It is important to know that **your local files and the GitHub repo will not be synced automatically**.  As described in Section \@ref(git-overview), you have to sync using git push when you are ready. We show you can do this through RStudio rather than the terminal below.

Before we start working on a collaborative project, usually the first thing we do is _pull_ in the changes from the remote repo, in our case the one on GitHub. However, for the example shown here, since we are starting with an empty repo and we are the only ones making changes, we don't need to start by pulling.

In RStudio, the status of the file as it relates to the remote and local repos are represented in the status symbols with colors. A yellow square means that Git knows nothing about this file. To sync with the GitHub repo, we need to _add_ the file, then _commit_ the change to our local Git repo, then _push_ the change to the GitHub repo. Right now, the file is just on our computer. To add the file using RStudio, we click the _Stage_ box. You will see that the status icon now changes to a green A.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[91])
```

Note: we are only adding the _code.R_ file. We don't necessarily need to add all the files in our local repo to the GitHub repo, only the ones we want to keep track of or the ones we want to share. If our work is producing files of a certain type that we do not want to keep track of, we can add the suffix that defines these files to the .gitignore file. More details on using .gitignore are included here: [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). These files will stop appearing in your RStudio Git pane. For the example shown here, we will only be adding _code.R_. But, in general, for an RStudio project, we recommend adding both the .gitignore and .Rproj files.

Now we are ready to commit the file to our local repo. In RStudio, we can use the _Commit_ button. This will open a new dialog window. With Git, whenever we commit a change, we are required to enter a comment describing the changes being _committed_.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[92])
```

In this case, we will simply describe that we are adding a new script. In this dialog box, RStudio also gives you a summary of what you are changing to the GitHub repo. In this case, because it is a new file, the entire file is highlighted as green, which highlights the changes.

Once we hit the commit button, we should see a message from Git with a summary of the changes that were committed. Now we are ready to _push_ these changes to the GitHub repo. We can do this by clicking on the _Push_ button on the top right corner:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[93:94])
```

We now see a message from Git letting us know that the push has succeeded.
In the pop-up window we no longer see the `code.R` file. This is because no new changes have been performed since we last pushed. We can exit this pop-up window now and continue working on our code.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[95:96])
```

If we now visit our repo on the web, we will see that it matches our local copy.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[97])
```

Congratulations, you have successfully shared code on a GitHub repository!

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = NULL, out.extra = NULL)
```

### R

The final product of a data analysis project is often a report. Many scientific publications can be thought of as a final report of a data analysis. The same is true for news articles based on data, an analysis report for your company, or lecture notes for a class on how to analyze data. The reports are often on paper or in a PDF that includes a textual description of the findings along with some figures and tables resulting from the analysis.

Imagine that after you finish the analysis and the report, you are told that you were given the wrong dataset, you are sent a new one and you are asked to run the same analysis with this new dataset. Or what if you realize that a mistake was made and need to re-examine the code, fix the error, and re-run the analysis? Or imagine that someone you are training wants to see the code and be able to reproduce the results to learn about your approach?

Situations like the ones just described are actually quite common for a data scientist. Here, we describe how you can keep your data science projects organized with RStudio so that re-running an analysis is straight-forward. We then demonstrate how to generate reproducible reports with R markdown and the __knitR__ package in a way that will greatly help with recreating reports with minimal work. This is possible due to the fact that R markdown documents permit code and textual descriptions to be combined into the same document, and the figures and tables produced by the code are automatically added to the document.

### R markdown

R markdown is a format for _literate programming_ documents. It is based on _markdown_, a markup language that is widely used to generate html pages. You can learn more about markdown here: [https://www.markdowntutorial.com/](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). Literate programming weaves instructions, documentation, and detailed comments in between machine executable code, producing a document that describes the program that is best for human understanding (Knuth 1984). Unlike a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, where what you see is what you get, with R markdown, you need to _compile_ the document into the final report. The R markdown document looks different than the final product. This seems like a disadvantage at first, but it is not because, for example, instead of producing plots and inserting them one by one into the word processing document, the plots are automatically added.

In RStudio, you can start an R markdown document by clicking on _File_, _New File_, the _R Markdown_. You will then be asked to enter a title and author for your document. We are going to prepare a report on gun murders so we will give it an appropriate name. You can also decide what format you would like the final report to be in: HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word. Later, we can easily change this, but here we select html as it is the preferred format for debugging purposes:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[104:105])
```

This will generate a template file:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[106])
```

As a convention, we use the `Rmd` suffix for these files.

Once you gain experience with R Markdown, you will be able to do this without the template and can simply start from a blank template.

In the template, you will see several things to note.


#### The header

At the top you see:

```
---
title: "Report on Gun Murders"
author: "Rafael Irizarry"
date: "April 16, 2018"
output: html_document
---
```

The things between the `---` is the header. We actually don't need a header, but it is often useful. You can define many other things in the header than what is included in the template. We don't discuss those here, but much information is available online. The one parameter that we will highlight is `output`. By changing this to, say, `pdf_document`, we can control the type of output that is produced when we compile.

#### R code chunks

In various places in the document, we see something like this:

````
```{r}`r ''`
summary(pressure)
```
````

These are the code chunks. When you compile the document, the R code inside the chunk, in this case `summary(pressure)`, will be evaluated and the result included in that position in the final document.

To add your own R chunks, you can type the characters above quickly with the key binding command-option-I on the Mac and Ctrl-Alt-I on Windows.

This applies to plots as well; the plot will be placed in that position. We can write something like this:


````
```{r}`r ''`
plot(pressure)
```
````

By default, the code will show up as well. To avoid having the code show up, you can use an argument. To avoid this, you can use the argument `echo=FALSE`. For example:




````
```{r echo=FALSE}`r ''`
summary(pressure)
```
````


We recommend getting into the habit of adding a label to the R code chunks. This will be very useful when debugging, among other situations. You do this by adding a descriptive word like this:



````
```{r pressure-summary}`r ''`
summary(pressure)
```
````


#### Global options

One of the R chunks contains a complex looking call:



````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````


We will not cover this here, but as you become more experienced with R Markdown, you will learn the advantages of setting global options for the compilation process.


#### knitR

We use the __knitR__ package to compile R markdown documents. The specific function used to compile is the `knit` function, which takes a filename as input.  RStudio provides a button that makes it easier to compile the document. For the screenshot below, we have edited the document so that a report on gun murders is produced. You can see the file here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rairizarry/murders/master/report.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rairizarry/murders/master/report.Rmd). You can now click on the `Knit` button:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[107])
```


The first time you click on the _Knit_ button, a dialog box may appear asking you to install packages you need.
<!--
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[108])
```
-->

Once you have installed the packages, clicking the _Knit_ will compile your R markdown file and the resulting document will pop up:


This produces an html document which you can see in your working directory. To view it, open a terminal and list the files. You can open the file in a browser and use this to present your analysis. You can also produce a PDF or Microsoft document by changing:

`output: html_document` to `output: pdf_document` or `output: word_document`.

We can also produce documents that render on GitHub using `output: github_document`.

This will produce a markdown file, with suffix `md`, that renders in GitHub. Because we have uploaded these files to GitHub, you can click on the `md` file and you will see the report as a webpage:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[125])
```

This is a convenient way to share your reports.

#### More on R markdown

There is a lot more you can do with R markdown. We highly recommend you continue learning as you gain more experience writing reports in R. There are many free resources on the internet including:

* RStudio's tutorial: [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
* The cheat sheet: [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
* The knitR book: [https://yihui.name/knitr/](https://yihui.name/knitr/)


## How to get Help

#### Searching for Help with R

Google is your friend. Searching for help, especially when you are not sure what you are looking for, is more art than science. Adding certain strings to the search query --- like "R", "tidyverse", or "ggplot" --- often helps. Some locations are high quality (anything to do with RStudio or tidyverse) while others are less good than they initially appear (sthda.com, r-statistics.co, rdocumentation.org).

#### Reproducible Examples

The best way to get help from other people is to create a **rep**roducible **ex**ample --- a so-called "reprex" --- which shows an example of the problem you are having. 

Install the **reprex** package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")
```

Load the library:

```{r}
library(reprex)
```

The code for your reproducible example needs to exist somewhere *before* you can use it to create your reprex. It is tempting to just grab it from the current file in which you are working, usually either a .R or .Rmd. Instead, I recommend creating a new file, dedicated to the example. Call it whatever.R. This makes everything easier, not least because some of the code you need, like the calls to *library* will often be many lines away, in your original file, from the code which is generating your error. Creating a stand-alone file helps to make the problem clear in your own head. Example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(new_var = mpg + cly)
```

Running this code produces an error because I have misspelled `cyl` as `cly`. Try it! To create a reprex:

1. Highlight the code.
1. Press Ctrl-C (or the equivalent) to copy the code to the clipboard.
1. Type `reprex()` at the R prompt.

The reproducible example now exists in two places. First, you can see it in the Viewer pane in RStudio. Second, it is on your clipboard. 

Next step is to go to [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) (or whatever location at which you want to ask your question), create a new post, and paste in the reprex from your clipboard. Of course, you may first have to create an account. Also, your post will need a title, associated text and perhaps other information like tags. The key point is that using a reproducible example makes it much likelier that someone will answer your question.

[Here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/best-practices-how-to-prepare-your-own-data-for-use-in-a-reprex-if-you-can-t-or-don-t-know-how-to-reproduce-a-problem-with-a-built-in-dataset/5346) is advice about using your own data in making a reprex. [Datapasta](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datapasta/vignettes/how-to-datapasta.html) may also be relevant.
