*.html

# I get annoyed at checking in a libs/ folder everywhere, but maybe we should 
# check them in? If you don't, then, unless you have build the html
# file for a chapter yourself, it won't show up nicely when you open it.

**/*libs

# I don't think that it matters that these files are not pushed for each chapter. 
# Might need to revisit this if we start cache'ing results so that the book builds faster.
