# Summer

## Next Meeting

ms-errors and simpsons-paradox. What do we do?

Expanding Maria's animation in chapter 5.

## TODO

0) Why do chapters 7 and 8 link to chapter 3 from the TOC on the web? Why are appendicing sections numbered like they are connected to chapter 9? Why did references stop working in chapter 9 (or earlier)?
  + Chapter 7 and 8 are not working because of duplicate heading names in Chapter 3 (lines 474 and 586). These need to be changed to something other than One Parameter and Two Parameter. THe references page is leading to Chapter 3 b/c of the same reasoning.
  + I'm not sure why the appendicing section numbering is on chapter 9, still need to dig deeper into that.
  + The reference labels in Chapter 9 were used incorrectly. You dont need a hashtag when referencing:

  Wrong: \@ref(#one-parameter)
  Right: \@ref(one-parameter)

1) Why aren't all the package references showing up in the bibliography?
  + This goes back to why I added nocite: '@*' to include everything inside the bib files - You can only choose to have everything show up or only the referenced items using @ to show up, there is no in-between.
  + We might want to have authors reference a package if they're introducing it (At least this is what moderndive does: https://moderndive.com/5-regression.html search for janitor)
  + Another solution would be to include a list of packages used like [so](https://moderndive.com/E-appendixE.html) and reference them all there.

2) Can you get **renv** working in your repo? Then submit a PR.

## DK

Understand bibliography.

 https://github.com/itsyaoyu/github_actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml
 https://www.willandskill.se/en/deleting-your-git-commit-history-without-removing-repo-on-github-bitbucket/

Discuss how to set a stable version of PPBDS.data which we do not touch all semester, and then have a devel branch in which we are fixing all the mistakes.

Explore: bookdown::pdf_book(base_format = msmbstyle::msmb_html_book())

Clean up bok repo to test this:

rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/davidkane9/PPBDS.data.git
git push -u --force origin master

Set up organization for the book.

Add necessary references to the references.bib and ensure that they are called correctly.

## Social Media Plan

1) Students look at three main things when deciding to take a course (sent from one of our new followers on Instagram!):
  - Q Guide scores and reviews
  - The professor (or preceptor!)
  - Anecdotal stoties from friends

2) We need more from you! Pictures and vertical videos for Instagram about your everyday life. Students value the human connection even more in remote learning.

3) We also need more from Gov 50 alumn! I have an interactive story that will go up once we hit 250 followers that alumn will share. We can also create sponsored posts/stories if students are interested. I have already approved my personal account and will post a sponsored post soon.

4) Advertising logistics:
  - We can target 18-22 year-old users associated with Harvard College and living in the US.
  - $25 total, $5/day campaign will have an estimated reach of 2,500-6,600 accounts.
  - Depending on your budget, I suggest we run 2-4 of these campaigns in August.
  - Each campaign will promote one of our best performing posts: I have some appropriate memes scheduled to post soon and Q Guide Score Quotes.

## Book Building

* [*Bookdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) is the key reference. Note that you need to uncomment the `html:` in _bookdown.yml in order for thus build command to work (This means selecting the order of Rmd files to knit). We usually build the book by pressing the "Build Book" button under the Build panel.

* We are using the Stanford example.
  + Make sure the **msmbstyle** package is installed
  + `msmbstyle::msmb_html_book` in the _output.yml file outputs to the Stanford format
  + To set the book color to crimson:
    + go to docs/libs/msmb-css-0/msmb.css
    + Find `#1881c2` and replace all with `#c90016`
    + Find `24,129,194` and replce with `201,0,23`
    + Save the file. No need to rebuild the book.

* We deploy to Github pages in the docs/ directory.. This assumes you have a Netifly account already.
  + Follow instructions [here](https://cerebralmastication.com/2019/05/11/publishing-bookdown-to-netlify-automagically/)

* For structure, we decided to have a single _output.yml file, which each chapter must include as so:
---
output_yaml:
  - _output.yml
---

* To ensure that all references appear, make sure the following is added to index.Rmd header:
---
nocite: '@*'
---


## Open Questions

* Need to start using tidybayes and ggdist. Can we use these in chapter 5 somehow? https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidybayes/vignettes/tidy-rstanarm.html


* Is there a way to print out messages during the book building process so that you know where the process is? Recall that we can't (?) use R code chunk names because duplicate code chunk names cause (still?) the process to blow up.

* Consider using notes: https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2019/making-tip-boxes-with-bookdown-and-rmarkdown/

* Think about packages. Note that the [545 book](https://github.com/rstudio-education/stat545) uses a fairly sophisticated plan, involving the new **renv** package.

* Can you rebuild just a single chapter and then commit/push it? Right now, I have to rebuild the whole thing each time I want to make a single change. Takes too long.

* How do we centralize the loading of packages? What is our plan for loading libraries and removing them when they are no longer need? Chapter 11 contained an annoying bug: rvest and purrr both have pluck() as a function. Need to ensure that you get the purrr version if you need it. Bug only showed up when Chapter 5 (with rvest loaded) was used in the build. Organize packages. What are all the packages we need? How do we ensure that we cite them all, as we should? Where do we load them? Again, there must be best practices for stuff like this. Only use high quality packages, and recommend the same to readers. When are different packages introduced? Where is this written down? Need to be intentional about what we introduced outside of the tidyverse --- janitor, ggthemes, reprex, fs, skimr, gt, googlesheets4, infer, gtsummary --- and when we do it. One annoyance is that new contributors have to try to compile the book a dozen times before it will work because there is no way to know, ahead of time, which packages are required. Make the book an R package?

* The book has lots of references, especially to other chapters. Many of these don't work because the referred-to chapters don't exist. We need a thorough clean up.


## Other Items


The world confronts us. We must make decisions. The data we want is missing. So, we create models, make estimates, admit to our uncertainty, and then decide.

## Unclassified Items

* Fix "No additional resources" in Chapter 6 and 7. Standardize this section across all chapters. 545 is different. Delete everywhere?

* Take (?) material from: https://chabefer.github.io/STCI/; https://github.com/chabefer/SKY

* Some chapters, like productivity.Rmd have a lot of footnotes. Good or bad?

* Revisit the Prediction Game.

### From the Bookdown book

preview_chapter() and serve_book() as aid to chapter writers.

webshot() tool for including images taken from webpages. Everytime we mention how cool source X is, we should provide a webshot of it. (And we should test that it exists.) Make the productivity chapter include way less of our prose.

switch to tufte() style, ask Healy. Or this guy: http://nickchk.com/chapter5.pdf

Kindle book

put the book on bookdown.org, or class assignments


Key concepts which need to be put everywhere:

decisions need models
potential outcomes and causal effects
units, treatments, outcomes
randomization is magic: assignment to estimate causal effects, bootstrap to estimate uncertainty

Describe, predict, infer. Description of things you can see, prediction for things you will see and inference about things you will never see.

Prediction checks.

Bias/Variance == Underfitting/Overfitting

Drop all the frequentist nonsense except for a footnote at the first use with a confidence interval and an appendix which walks students through the Kuske arguments.


Discuss RCM, assuming that we are estimating a causal effect of some type. And, if we are not estimating causal effects (i.e., all we care about is prediction), then the mechanics of lm are the same, but the interpretation of the regression coefficient has no causal implications.  We want a series of tables illustrating potential outcomes and our estmation of them. Start with a table with ?, just as in the Appendix. We use linear regression to fill in these questions marks. Show table with question marks and then show table with question marks filled in with best guess. Then show table with question marks filled in with a confidence interval for the mean and then for a distribution of predicted values. The closer we can tie RCM to the different parts of a regression, the better. But do this each chapter, not just regression.



Each chapter should finish with a new section which uses list-columns plus broom to estimate scores of models, and then pull out interesting models. See the gapminder examples from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html#gapminder. We need the full tool set: nest, unnest and so on.

Each chapter begins with a real example, a decision we must make (if only the prediction game), and then creates a model which we will use to help us. Bets are always offered. RCM discussed. Bias scenarios demonstrated. The secret weapon --- a model for each state or each year --- used.


## Other summer issues

## Approaches to Include?

xgboost: https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-xgboost-with-tidymodels/

I really like the Kruchke and brms combination: https://bookdown.org/content/3686/

### Use of Note Boxes

https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2019/making-tip-boxes-with-bookdown-and-rmarkdown/


http://statprep.org/

## Other Topics


missing data
regresssion towards the mean
prediction/classification
map/network/text

"docknitr: Use Docker Images to Process Rmarkdown Blocks" looks promising. Note the vignettes. But maybe this is a) overkill and b) only really useful for Python, which is what is used for the docknitr vignette examples. The methods used by STAT 545 and Modern Dive are probably good enough.


# Notes on **bookdown** Book

p. 64 notes that adding the suffix 2 to various output formats gives you all the cool stuff, like figure captioning and numbering.

p. 74 has a useful discussion of configuration options for the _bookdown.yml file.

* rmd_subdir are subdirectories to search for source Rmd files. That seems critical for my submodule structure.

* output_dir is the output directory of the process (_book by default).

* clean is vector of files and directories to be cleaned by the clean_book() function.

pp. 5-6 discuss rmd_files as the way to define your own ordering for output files. This also goes in the _bookdown.yml file.

Probably worth going through the book again in January.


# Appendices

Appendices have information that either a) a prof might reasonably decide not to assign or b) often contain material that students already know.

* Why Bayes?

* Messed up research articles. We need to prepare case studies of messed up articles. Start with those that Gelman cites. The tricky part is trying to figure out how to include these in class. And during which week do we use them.

* Cartoons like [xkcd](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RXKCD)? Others? We should have lots of these, either in an appendix or as margin notes.

* Videos like [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/learnr-videos.html). Use knitr::include_url with embed/id? It is an on-line book, so space is no object! Start by collecting the best work in an appendix.

* All the math you don't need to know. Bayes Theorem. Formulas. Normal distribution. Central limit theorem

* How to Make Tables using gt package, other stuff?

https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-16-gt-a-grammer-of-tables/

* List of cool packages, googlesheet4 examples. : https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/10-example/

* Cool Graphics Things -- ggplotly

* How to make an Rpubs and gists and saveWidgets:
https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/10-example/

* Tufte and other graphics luminaries

* Leamer and other famous articles

* rtweet (Cassidy)

* Making memes. Someone should figure out which meme maker is best for R. Or maybe we make our own. And then we make lots of memes for the book!

* Map appendix should include some Matt Blackwell examples.

* Entry about best class.
