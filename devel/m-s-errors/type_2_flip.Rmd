## Now, we want to test if there is a difference in hours between the Computer Science and Government departments. We already know that Government courses average about 5 hours per week, and Computer Science courses average about 11 hours. A t-test of the full data would reject the null and see a significant difference in means. However, we are again limited and can only see the reported hours for 5 randomly chosen courses in each department.

##### We see that our samples are really similar, even though the full populations aren't. Using this sample, we'd conclude the true means were very close, and fail to reject the null hypothesis, even though using a complete dataset shows the alternate hypothesis is correct. This is a Type 2 error!

.pull-left[
##### If we simulate a real 5-course sampling of the government and CS departments, many times, we see that we will get a type 2 error about 52% of the time. We get so many errors because our sample size is small, and so the effect isn't large enough to show up consistently.
