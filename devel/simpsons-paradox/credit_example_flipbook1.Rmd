# A Simple Linear Regression Using Income to Explain Debt Confirms the Positive Relationship


```{r show_table_of_debt_model_1_highlighted, echo = FALSE}
debt_model_1_table_table_highlight
```

--

When we perform a simple linear regression using income to explain debt in this data, we find that an increase in income by $1,000 is associated with a $`r round(coef(debt_model_1)[2],2)` increase in debt. 

---

# The Puzzle

## So why is it that the coefficient on income is *negative* when we control for credit limit in a multiple linear regression using both income and credit limit as explanatory variables?

```{r show_table_of_debt_model_2, echo = FALSE}
debt_model_2_table_table

```{r show_table_of_debt_model_2_highlighted, echo = FALSE}
debt_model_2_table_table_highlight
```

--
Now, we expect that if two individuals of the same credit limit differ by $1,000 in income, the individual with the higher income will have $`r -1 * round(coef(debt_model_2)[3],2)` *less* in debt.

In this example, credit limit is a *confounding variable* of the relationship between credit card debt and income. Thus, credit limit needs to be accounted for in any appropriate model for the relationship between debt and income.
