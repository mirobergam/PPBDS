This directory contians all files needed to create the "simpsons_tufte.html" output.

The "basic_simpsons_flipbook.Rmd" file generates the "basic_simpsons_flipbook.html" page.

The "credit_example_flipbook1.Rmd" file generates the "credit_example_flipbook_1.html" page. 

The "simpsons_tufte.Rmd" creates the "simpsons_tufte.html" page and embedds both of the flipbook html outputs within it. 

The "basic_simpsons_flipbook.Rmd" and "credit_example_flipbook1.Rmd" must be run (or the gifs/outputs they generate must be already in the directory) before running "simpsons_tufte.Rmd" in order for the visualizaitons in the flipbooks to render correctly in "simpsons_tufte.html"
