<!-- This is not a bad cover. But we really should do more. We should add some text about each of the virtues, beginning with the Latin term. Of course, we don't have the space to go into how these terms connect to concepts in data science. Also, it might be nice to tie the book title more closely into this display. -->

<!-- Kay had me take out Ke$ha, but I would like to bring her back as an avatar for students. She is not so much the fifth virtue as she is us, aspiring to practice these virtues. -->

And what is romantic, Kay ---  
And what is love?  
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
