# Forward {-}

The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere persuasion or at least a subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is betting. Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident and inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all concern for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he is persuaded enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily bet one, but at 10 he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not previously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred. -â€” Immanuel Kant, *Critique of Pure Reason*

The world confronts us. Make decisions we must.

# Warning {-}

This book is not the book you are looking for.

First, the book is for students in [Gov 1005: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html), a course offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. Some of the material here may be useful to students outside of this class, but I don't really care if it is.

Second, the book changes all the time. It is as up-to-date as possible.

Third, I am highly opinionated about what matters and what does not. It is unlikely that you share my views.

And what is romantic, Kay ---  
And what is love?  
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
