# Cover {-}

<!-- This is not a bad cover. But we really should do more. First, we need a good close up of each of the 4 cardinal virtues. It is hard to see them in this shot. Then we need Kesha to be placed in parallel to them. She is not so much the fifth virtue as she is us, aspiring to practice these virtues. Then, we might add some text about each of the virtues, beginning with the Latin term. Of course, we don't have the space to go into how these terms connect to concepts in data science. Also, it might be nice to tie the book title more closely into this display. Also, maybe we should be using the full width here.  -->

The [Cardinal Virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues) of Bayesian data science are [Prudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence), [Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_(virtue)), [Courage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage), and [Temperance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_(virtue)). Come learn them with us.

[Kesha's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesha) "[We R Who We R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_R_Who_We_R)" is the official theme song of this book.

And what is love?  
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
